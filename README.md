# Tasks2

Design Choices:

1. Each user/manager can manage themself. 
Any user in the system will be allowed to manage themself. If this were not the case, and if there were only a single user in the system, e.g. the first user in the system, then the user won't be assigned any tasks and would be idle, unless some other user registers as their manager.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
